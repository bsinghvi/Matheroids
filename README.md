## How to play Matheroids:
1. Solve the equation presented quickly
2. Use left and right arrow keys to turn the ship and aim to target an asteroid 
2. Hit space to shoot a laser
4. If the asteroid hit has the correct solution, player receives 100 points
5. If the asteroid hit has the incorrect solution, player loses 100 points and the other asteroids speed up
6. Gain lives by shooting the floating heart

## This Java Game Implements:
1. Java Applet API
2. Objects (Ship, Laser, and Asteroids)
